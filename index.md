## Welcome to the Photozilla Dataset

   The advent of social media platforms has been a catalyst for the development of digital photography that engendered a boom in vision applications. With this motivation, we introduce a large-scale dataset termed `Photozilla', which includes over $990k$ images belonging to $10$ different photographic styles. The dataset is then used to train $3$ classification models to automatically classify the images into the relevant style which resulted in an accuracy of $\sim96\%$. With the rapid evolution of digital photography, we have seen new types of photography styles emerging at an exponential rate. On that account, we present a novel Siamese-based network that uses the trained classification models as the base architecture to adapt and classify unseen styles with only $25$ training samples. We report an accuracy of over $68\%$ for identifying 10 other distinct types of photography styles.
